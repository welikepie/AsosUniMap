It was therefore necessary for biblical writers to frequently call attention to this phenomenon. One writer who repeatedly warns the brethren was the apostle John. In one of these statements he declares: “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world” (1 John 4:1, ASV). \nGod’s people must heed this same warning today. As false teachers saturated society within the first century, it is no less true in the twenty-first century. The Lord’s church today is assaulted on every side by those teaching destructive heresies. It is incumbent upon God’s people to take seriously their responsibility as guardians of the truth. God expects and demands this of us. \nFollowing, is an exposition of 1 John 4:1. An appreciation for this divine directive will help motivate us to “test the spirits” in order to determine whether certain doctrines originate with God or man. \nFALSE PROPHETS \nThe phrase “false prophets” translates a single term in the original, a compound word composed of pseudo and prophetes. The term occurs 11 times in the New Testament. Its first occurrence is when Jesus warned the disciples of the deceptive nature of false teachers — “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves” (Matt. 7:15). Within the biblical context, a “prophet” is a proclaimer of the divine will which could not ordinarily be known except by special revelation. The true prophet was an inspired spokesman for God. \nThe term pseudo is often prefixed to words in the New Testament to denote the spurious (false) character of the one mentioned or the deceptive nature of the thing referred. For example, besides “false prophets” there are “false Christs” (Matt. 24:24), “false teachers” (2 Peter 2:1), “false apostles” (2 Cor. 11:13), “false brethren” (Gal. 2:4) and “false witnesses” (Matt. 26:20). The apostle Paul even prefixes pseudo to the noun logos (word) to characterize the false teacher as a liar (1 Tim. 4:2). This latter sort is especially dangerous because through “hypocrisy” they are “like actors who play parts so well that their words have the ring of truth” (BDAG, 1096). \nThus, the false prophet is the counterfeit whose claims are bogus concerning himself and his message. He is a fraud who pretends to speak by inspiration of the Spirit, or at least on God’s behalf, but in actuality preaches a message of human origin. His message does not comply with God’s word. When one preaches that which is not in harmony with divine revelation, that person is a false prophet. This kind must be rejected. Association on a spiritual plane cannot be extended because his efforts are detrimental to the cause of Christ. Those who sympathize with and support a false teacher becomes a “partaker” (fellow-shipper) of his corrupt works (2 John 9-11). \nMANY ARE GONE OUT \nThe term “many” relates the numerous amounts of false prophets operating at the time the apostle wrote this epistle. John says “even now have there arisen many antichrists” (1 John 2:18). In his next epistle he continues to assert that “many deceivers are gone forth into the world” (2 John 7). This high quantity of false teachers agitating the brotherhood was anticipated by Jesus: “And many false prophets shall arise and shall lead many astray” (Matt. 24:11). Paul states there were “many adversaries” (1 Cor. 16:9), “many corrupting the word of God” (2 Cor. 2:17), “many enemies of the cross of Christ” (Phil. 3:18), and “many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers” (Titus 1:10). \nNotice that the ratio of those misled by doctrinal error is proportionate to the abundance of false prophets. The existence of many false teachers results in the deception of many innocent people. These are the percentages Peter had in mind when he wrote, “And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of” (2 Peter 2:2). Sadly, we have a large class of brethren today who do not believe there are any false teachers. But the Bible clearly depicts that there were many in existence even while the apostles were still living. A quick survey of doctrinal deviations dispensed throughout the land suggests there is no reason to believe their tribe has decreased in modern times. \nThe phrase “gone out” translates a single verb. Grammatically, the form is a perfect tense which may be the most exegetically significant of all the Greek tenses (Moulton, 140). Since the perfect is employed less frequently than the present, aorist, future, or imperfect tenses, when it is used there is usually a deliberate choice on the part of the writer. The force of the perfect is that it describes an event completed in the past (in the indicative mood) which has results in the present time (i.e., in relation to the time of the speaker/author). The resultant state which proceeds from the past action is presented as a continuous state. It is a combination of the aorist and present tenses. In this sense, the perfect relates a completed action with continuous, existing results (Wallace, 572-573). Another describes the perfect tense as indicating a “present state of affairs” resulting from a past action (Zerwick, 96). \nThe specific use of this tense here is called an “intensive” (or “resultative“) perfect. This kind of perfect is used when the writer wishes to emphasize not so much the past event but rather the results or present state produced by the action of the past. It is not that the use of the perfect excludes the notion of a completed act, but rather that the focus is on the results which follows. The significance of this is that John wants to call special attention, not merely to the fact that false teachers had gone forth into society (a past event), but specifically that the insidious influence of their error was presently continuing to affect the brotherhood of God’s people at the very time he wrote this warning to the brethren (Vincent, 2:355). Although the difference is subtle, the KJV (followed by the ASV) captures this nuance better than the modern translations — “many false prophets are gone out into the world” in contrast to “have gone out” (NIV, NRSV, etc.). This is not surprising. Reputable scholars are on record as acknowledging the KJV’s “superior rendering of the Greek Perfect over many modern translations” (Wallace, 575). \nA comparison of the passage under discussion with 1 John 2:19 where the apostle says the false teachers “went out from us” and 2 John 7 where he says they “are gone forth into the world,” results in some grammatical dividends. In all three passages the apostle employs the same verb to describe the going forth of the false teachers, but in the latter two passages he portrays this action with the aorist tense rather than the perfect. This is significant because often the choice of tense used by the speaker/writer is made for the specific purpose of describing the specific kind of action he wishes to portray. The significance of the perfect tense is that John wants to call special attention to the fact that the influence of the false teachers was presently continuing to affect the brotherhood at the very time he wrote this warning to the brethren. \nBut with the aorist tense, John is concerned more with emphasizing the simple fact that the false teachers have left. This is done with the aorist which is the way an action is portrayed in summary form; the action is portrayed as a whole, including both the beginning and ending point. The whole occurrence of the false teachers’ exit from the faithful is viewed as a single entity regardless of its internal make-up. This is not to deny that the false teacher continued to influence God’s people in a negative way as portrayed elsewhere with the perfect tense. There is simply a different emphasis underscored with the use of the aorist. The fact that the false teachers “went out” is given in snap shot form by the aorist tense — the false teachers have left (“they went out from us“). The significance of the aorist tense here is that with it John articulates that now the false teachers are gone, they have left, and are no longer to be considered a part of the fellowship of God’s people (Fanning, 255- 256). \nBELIEVE NOT EVERY SPIRIT \nJohn uses a couple of imperatives to set forth the obligation which God’s people are to implement toward false teachers. The first comes negatively whereas the second takes the force of a positive command. The apostle has just referenced the commandment to “believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ” (1 John 3:23). He then offers an immediate contrast at 4:1 with the first of two imperatives — “believe not every spirit.” While there are several uses for the imperative in biblical Greek, the primary usage it to set forth a command. Here, this one takes the form of a prohibition. An action is being forbidden. Since the imperative is the mood of intention, it moves in the realm of volition which involves one imposing their will upon another. In this context, God imposes his will upon his children by commanding them not to believe certain doctrines even though they fly under the banner of a religious message. As in any command, it sets forth an obligation and not an optional choice. It might initially seem strange that God would command his people not to be gullible or naive in doctrinal matters. Yet, this is exactly what this prohibition entails. There are some doctrines God absolutely forbids people to believe. \nWhen God says “believe not every spirit but prove the spirits,” the meaning is that one is not to believe any religious teaching without proper discrimination. The term “spirits” is an allusion to the prophets and their messages. This is indicated by the immediate reference to “prophets” in the second half of this verse. The Holy Spirit miraculously inspired prophets in the first century church so as to progressively reveal truth through them. These inspired prophets were called “spirits” (2 Thess. 2:2) or “spiritual” (1 Cor. 14:37) because they possessed the spiritual gift of prophecy. But the term “spirit” can reference “an activating spirit that is not from God... [and] Because there are persons activated by such spirits, it is necessary to test the various kinds of spirits” (BDAG, 836). This being the case, the term pneuma (spirit) in the passage under consideration is used as “metonymy of the cause.” This is a figure of speech whereby the term is put for the prophets and special revelation communicated through them (Bullinger, 543). The sense of the passage, then, is as follows: “believe not every spirit [i.e., every doctrine spoken by a prophet presumably inspired of the Spirit], but prove the spirits [i.e., doctrines supposedly given from prophets inspired by the Spirit], whether they [i.e., the presumably prophetic doctrines] originate with God.” To test the “spirits” then, was in effect, to test the particular pneuma under whose impulsion the prophets spoke — the “Spirit of truth” (cf. John 16:13) or the “spirit of error” (v.6). \nPROVE THE SPIRITS \nThe second imperative complements the first — “prove the spirits, whether they are of God.” One is to reject (believe not) certain doctrines, but only after those teachings have been evaluated in light of God’s inspired will and found to be in noncompliance with revealed truth. The term “prove” relates this evaluative process. Paul uses the exact same imperative form — “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good” (1 Thess. 5:21). The word can express a couple of different nuances of which both may be embedded in its meaning here. First, it means to make a critical examination of something in order to determine its authenticity, put to the test, examine. Second, it signifies to draw a conclusion about something as genuine or worthy on the basis of that testing, to prove, approve (BDAG, 255; Louw/Nida, 364). \nThis evaluative process cannot be accomplished without the first idea and pragmatically would include the second. Once a doctrine has been examined, if it passes or fails the test, it must then, from a practical standpoint, be approved or disapproved. Every doctrine is to be critically examined in light of whether or not it is genuine. But a part of the complete process involves the second definition as well — the doctrine examined now must receive approval when it passes the test. It is not enough to merely test a doctrine. It must then receive approbation if part of authentic truth. Only then should any teaching be embraced by faith and obeyed as saving truth. Our responsibility in this matter should never be taken frivolously. The eternal welfare of souls is at stake. \nThat John uses the imperative in the present tense is significant. What must be appreciated is that “time” as an element of tense is basically non-existent in non-indicative moods such as the imperative. At the forefront is “aspect” or the way in which the writer wants to portray the action of the verb. John could have placed the imperative in another tense to relate a different kind of action. He chose, however, to use the present tense and probably for a specific reason. While contextual considerations must always be allowed for, the unaffected meaning of a present tense basically relates an activity as a continuous process, without the beginning or end in view. Thus, John not only commands brethren to “prove the spirits” but to do so as an ongoing process of operation. This specific kind of present is categorized as the “iterative present” (which is frequently used with the imperative mood). Therefore the idea conveyed is that of repeated, continuous action. This is repetitive action in the sense that it is done over and over, again and again (Wallace, 514, 520). The implication of this is that as long as false teachers circulate within society, the Lord’s church will continuously be under the God-given responsibility to keep on repeatedly testing the doctrines taught by those claiming to speak on God’s behalf. \nJohn says doctrines are to be tested to see whether or not they are “of God.” A consideration of the syntax here offers some exegetical dividends. In the original this grammatical construction consists of a preposition coupled with a noun in the genitive case. It may be categorized as a “genitive of source” (origin). This relates that a doctrine must have God as its source for it to pass the test and receive approval — it must be of God in the sense of being from God. If a religious teaching does not originate with God (if it is not derived from a Divine source), then it must be rejected as arising from some other cause (cf. “doctrines of demons,” 1 Tim. 4:1; but not the unwarranted “taught by demons” per the NIV). Today, if a religious teaching cannot be substantiated as coming from God’s book (the Bible), it ought not to be embraced as part of the “apostles’ doctrine” or the “doctrine of Christ” (Acts 2:42; 2 John 9). A false doctrine is nothing more than a religious message which does not come from God. Likewise, a false prophet is nothing more than one who preaches a religious message which cannot be substantiated by God’s Book (the Bible). Brethren will do well to heed these matters. \nFollowing is my translation of the verse under consideration. It is intended to be paraphrastic for the purpose of highlighting the verbal tenses and moods used by the inspired apostle: “Beloved, I command you, don’t believe every spirit! But I command you to repeatedly test the spirits to determine whether they originate with God, the reason why is because many false prophets are gone out into the world.” \n\nSources \nBullinger, E.

Newly released, state-of-the-art football helmets, for instance, may measure how much force each player’s head is absorbing and relay that data via telemetry to trainers on the sidelines, but at $1,500 or so per helmet, they are unattainable for most teams.\n\nWhich is why a study published recently in The British Journal of Sports Medicine is so appealing. Eminently practical, it offers a means by which any team, no matter how small or cash-strapped, can assess the likelihood of one of its players having sustained an on-field concussion. It also celebrates a nifty, D.I.Y., MacGyver-ish sensibility rarely seen in our technology-obsessed times.\n\nThe study’s authors began with the simple idea that, to manage sports-related concussions, “you need to be able to quickly and easily assess” whether a given player has actually sustained one, said Steven P. Broglio, director of the University of Michigan’s NeuroSport Research Laboratory and co-author of the study. Not every head impact results in a concussion.\n\nOne means of assessing concussion status, Dr. Broglio continued, is to look at a player’s reaction time, since it is known to increase immediately after a concussion. A variety of scientifically validated tools exist to measure players’ reaction times, but most require a computer and sophisticated software, and are not practicable on the sidelines or in the budgets of many teams.\n\nSo Dr. Broglio and his colleague Dr. James Eckner, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, set out to develop an inexpensive means of measuring reaction time. After some noodling, Dr. Eckner came up with the idea of attaching a hockey puck via adhesive to a long wooden dowel, and marking centimeters in ink along the length of the dowel.\n\nDr. James Travis Eckner of the University of Michigan administers the puck-and-dowel ruler test to check for concussion.\nDr. Steven Broglio\nDr. James Travis Eckner of the University of Michigan administers the puck-and-dowel ruler test to check for concussion.\nTo use the device, an evaluator simply holds it in front of an athlete who is seated at a table with one arm resting on the surface and his hand at the table’s edge. The evaluator aligns the puck with the bottom of the athlete’s hand and lets go. The athlete catches the falling stick. The evaluator marks where his hand lands, and, voila, a coach or trainer has a baseline measure of someone’s reaction time. Theoretically, should a player later be suspected of having sustained a concussion, the trainer could pull out the dowel-puck, repeat the test, and, if the player’s reaction time were slower, conclude that he or she likely was concussed.\n\nBut that idea required validation. So last year, Dr. Eckner, Dr. Broglio and their colleagues rigorously tested the reliability of their homemade reaction-time tool. They first used the dowel to measure pre-season reaction times of collegiate and high school football, soccer and hockey players. (The researchers determined actual reaction times by plugging the centimeter measures into mathematical formulas.)\n\nThen they waited, slightly ghoulishly, for the same athletes to become injured. The athletes obliged. During the season after baseline measurements were collected, 28 male and female athletes were diagnosed with concussions. Knowing that these athletes had sustained concussions, the scientists asked them to re-take the dowel test, in each case within at least 48 hours of the head injury.\n\nThey also asked another 28 of the originally tested athletes to retake the test, as controls.\n\nThe dowel-puck turned out to be a remarkably reliable indicator of a concussion. Those athletes who had sustained the injury were significantly slower now to grasp the dowel, often requiring a full second more. The un-concussed athletes, on the other hand, displayed equivalent or, in many cases, faster reaction times on their re-test.\n\nThe outcome of the testing was so consistent that even its developers seemed a bit taken aback. This “single, five-minute test” requiring “equipment costing less than five U.S. dollars” had “comparable test characteristics to other concussion assessment tools, including lengthier, computerized neuropsychological test batteries.”\n\nThe practical implications of this finding are obvious. Even the least handy of coaches or trainers can cobble together a makeshift ruler using a puck and dowel, use it to determine athletes’ baseline reaction times, and re-test any player who is suspected of sustaining a concussion. The test reliably can be administered on the sidelines immediately after a hard hit, Dr. Broglio said, and if a player shows any increase in reaction time, no matter how slight, the player should almost certainly be removed from play and seen by a doctor.\n\n“We’re not saying” that the dowel test is definitive, Dr. Broglio said. Concussions remain highly individualized, differing in severity and presentation from player to player. “The more tests that are used to assess” a player’s brain health, he said, “the better.” But thedowel measurement has the advantage of being readily available to any team, he points out, no matter how small their resources, if their will to protect their players is sufficiently ample.","img_small":null,"img_med":null,"img_large":null,"source":"FACEB","hashtag":"testing"},{"id":"1404961798_10201806845558568","user":"1404961798","time":"2013-08-14T17:39:44.000Z","lat":null,"lon":null,"text":"The only fair proposal I support is drug testing all members of the various political bodies.

The problem with\nadvice is that it’s almost always a product of\nour own unique experiences. It’s like a suit\nthat we’ve had tailored to fit us perfectly.\nBut then, we lend it freely and quickly to\nothers, forgetting that because it’s bespoke,\nno-one else looks quite as good in it as we do\nand as a result, there’s a whole lot of\nridiculous advice being shared. With that in\nmind, here’s a collection of 10 of the worst\nand most annoying startup advice and clichés:\n1. “Steve Jobs/Bill Gates/Mark Zuckerberg or\nsome other statistical anomaly did x, so you\nshould too”\nHere, we attribute foresight and expertise to\ndecisions that were more often that not merely\nlucky guesses, because we evaluate an already\nsuccessful person, in hindsight. Enjoy\nvomiting? I’d suggest you read this blog post\nabout what makes a great entrepreneur. It’s\nchock-full of bad advice and hyperbole about\nhow famous entrepreneurs “made it”.\n“Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the\nDallas Mavericks, said he didn’t take a day off\nfor seven years when he launched his first\nventure, MicroSolutions.”\nI hope the next thing he said was, “you know, I\nreally regret that. A lot of personal\nrelationships suffered as did my mental health.\nProbably, on reflection, I didn’t need to work\nthat hard. If I’d designed my business better\nfrom the beginning, it wouldn’t have needed me\nconstantly for 2,555 days in a row.”\nBad advice and clichés might seem like a light-\nhearted topic, but it’s actually quite\nsinister. It leads to wasted time and effort\nand a whole lot of hero worship around how many\nhours we work, or how many sacrifices we make.\nIt results in a lot of people putting\nunnecessary pressure on themselves to act a\ncertain way, often in the naïve belief that\nit’s admirable and that other successful people\nalso behave this way. It’s remembering the\nexceptions, but filing them away as rules.\n2. “Passion, Desire, Hunger and Commitment”\nRock\nLet’s just retire these words. From now let’s\nall agree that we’ll only use the word passion\nwhen it’s followed by the word fruit. Ideally\nthen followed by the word daiquiri.\nPassion is implied. Passion is why you are\nreading this article. Passion is why you don’t\nwork for Deutsche Post or a big bank. It’s why\nyou believe that in the face of all the advice\nthat tells you not to do it, to stick to your\nnice, safe, salaried day job, you’re doing it\nanyway. Passion is no longer a differentiator,\nit’s a prerequisite. It’s why you’re at the\nrace, but it’s not the reason you’ll win.\n3. Fake it ’til you make it\nFaking it until you make it is also known as\nlying. Lying is usually an act reserved for\nCVs, kids and sociopaths.\nWe owe it to everyone else to be honest, to\nshare both successes and failures. Otherwise it\nstarts looking like, based on our titles, our\npress releases, our websites and our business\ncards that everyone is succeeding. Then, if we\ntry something and it doesn’t work out, we take\nit as a personal failure. We think we’re the\nexception and not part of a larger rule. This\nleads people not to try, or if they do, but\ndon’t succeed it sends these founders into\nburnouts and depressions.\n4. “The secret of my success is…”\nIt’s nice that people take the time to share\nthe secrets of their success. But this only\nworks if we’re being really honest, doesn’t it?\nSo, when you tell me your 30 minute morning\nmindfulness mediation session is the secret of\nyour success, I’m doubtful. Want to know the\nsecret of my meagre success? Being born into\nthe life of a middle class, university educated\nwhite guy in the 5th richest country in the\nworld. Fortunate accidents of birth like that\ngive you better head starts than anything in\nLance Armstrong’s medicine cabinet.\n5. “It‘s x, only social”\nDouglas Adams once said “we need a word for\ninteractivity, like we need a special word for\na human with only one head.” It‘s the same with\nsocial.\nSocial is not a feature, nor is it a\ndifferentiator and it‘s not a topping that can\nbe added like salami for a pizza. We‘re humans\nso pretty much everything we do is social.\n6. “The Startup Ninja, Punk or Rockstar”\nTitles are nice and fun and I get why we use\nthem. But I‘m not sure we‘re picking relevant\nones.\nStartup Rockstar\nRockstars? If your job involves spreadsheets,\nemail or getting up before noon, you can be\nfairly sure that actual rockstars hate you and\ndon’t want you using their name in your job\nads.\nStartup Ninja\nNinjas? I guess they did kind of pioneer\n“stealth mode” but beyond that I imagine\nthey’re a little too busy being lethal deadly\nassassins to play Ping Pong with you in the\nchill out room. Which is a shame, because I’m\nsure they’d be great at it, with those reflexes\nand all.\nThe Business Punk\nPossibly the least applicable of all. I imagine\ntwo punks sitting around a bin fire and one\nsays, “what’s the most anti-establishment thing\nwe could do?” The other punk ponders for a\nmoment, then replies, “join the\nestablishment?” , “Brilliant!”\n7. “Turn your passion into a business”\nIf, like me, your passion is laying around on\nthe couch in your underwear and eating\nchocolate then I wouldn’t assume there’s\nanything profitable in that. Problems are\nprofitable. Passions, not so much.\n8. “If we build it, they will come”\nThis is true on several levels, especially if\nyou’re building a brothel. Otherwise, they\nwon’t.\nIt would be great if the world was a perfectly\ncalibrated machine, into the top of which we\npoured talent and hard work, and out dropped\nthe matching level of success. But it’s not.\nJust because something is good, or someone is\ntalented, doesn’t automatically mean it‘ll\nsucceed. Just because it’s bad, it won’t\nnecessarily fail. This is why Paris Hilton has\na bigger house than you, why Wyclef Jean is\nstill making music and why David Hasselhoff can\nrestart his career by getting drunk and eating\na burger off the floor.\nMarketing is how you recalibrate that broken\nmachine to give you the attention and success\nyou deserve. Knowing how you’re going to\npublicise the thing you’re doing is just as\nimportant as the actual thing you are doing.\nFor every minute you spend building it, for\nevery dollar you spend building it, you need to\ndo the same marketing it.\n9. “Pivot!”\nPunk\nDefinitely a growing trend here in Berlin, I\ncall it the “premature pivot”. It’s where you\nspend eight months building something, and\nyou’ve got your launchrock page up, but only\nnine people sign up, then you launch, email\nfive journalists, get no reply, write to\nTechCrunch, get no reply, send a newsletter to\nyour mum, get no reply (it’s not that she’s not\ninterested, she’s just busy and you really\nshould call her more), make a Facebook fan\npage, get a few dozen user signups, wait a\nmonth, add some new features, contact the press\nagain, decide you’ve got no traction, pivot,\nthen repeat.\n10. “The most important thing is x”\nThis one is more a general summary of the last\nnine, than a piece of bad advice. At different\nmeetups, keynotes and events, you’ll meet many\ndifferent people touting many different things\nas the most important. Run from anyone who\nclaims to know anything with any certainty.\nWe’re all viewing things from our own positions\nof bias a none of us have the answer.\nThe fundamental law of advice is as follows:\n“for every single piece of advice, there will\nbe another that directly contradicts it”.\nIn conclusion, if this all sounds negative, it\nshouldn’t. A startup, particularly the lean\nstartup methodology, is a reaction to\nambiguity. That’s kind of what a startup is,\nright? It’s a vehicle for the systematic\ntesting of hunches. Would people be willing to\npay for this? How much? Google Ads? Affiliate\nprogram? A/B test website copy? And so on and\nso on. The best startups are the most\nanalytical in the designing and testing of\ntheir hunches.\nIt’s not that everything matters and it’s not\nthat nothing matters, it’s that everything\nmatters until you know, categorically, through\ntesting, that it doesn’t matter.","img_small":null,"img_med":null,"img_large":null,"source":"FACEB","hashtag":"testing"},{"id":"657727097_10151598037777098","user":"657727097","time":"2013-08-14T17:30:50.000Z","lat":null,"lon":null,"text":"From Essential Oils 4 Healing\n\nGenuine Therapeutic Grade Essentials Oils\nIt takes life to get life! That's why \"genuine\" therapeutic grade essential oils are a rare and precious treasure, and just like searching for gold, so it is when searching for the purest and most powerful healing essential oils... which is even better than gold!\n\nWhen \"Quality Matters\"\n\nBefore I get into the importance of quality and what to look for lets first clarify…\n\nWhere The Term \"Therapeutic Grade\" Come From\nD. Gary Young, Founder, Pioneer, and World's Foremost Expert in Essential Oils is the one who actually coined the term “therapeutic-grade” over 20 years ago, which naturally carried over into Young Living Essential Oils.\n\nSeeing this term on a Young Living essential oil bottle means you have an absolute guarantee that you will only be buying 100% pure, natural, uncut oils from carefully identified plants, whose natural chemical profile matches or exceeds recognized world standards, such as AFNOR and ISO, as well as Young Livings own more comprehensive internal standards in order to maintain the vital therapeutic potency of each oil.\n\nThere was not then, and there is not now, an organization other than Young Living Essential Oils qualified to certify an essential oil as \"therapeutic grade.\"\n\nWhat Are Essential Oils?\n\nEssential oils, or natures living energy, are the most powerful, natural substance we have for protecting, healing, and restoring the body and mind. \n\nThey are the most powerful part of the plant, flower, shrub, tree, etc., and can be hundreds and even thousands of times more powerful and have significantly higher frequencies than fresh or dried herbs.\n\nI firmly believe these precious plant oils hold the answers so many are desperately seeking. However, there is one important fact that many don’t realize and that is that they, like most things, MUST be as pure as God created them to be. Quality care must be in place from the very beginning starting with the land and seeds used, when the oils are distilled and how long they are distilled. When it comes to producing an essential oil that can bring healing using the right land, seed, distillation method, timing and temperature is everything!\n\nAny shortcuts, dilution or tampering with these delicate oils, in any way, like they are doing to our foods and personal care products, for profits sake, during the process will produce an oil that is not fit for use. Oh, but they sell them anyway!\n\nOK, so lets get back and learn about quality... \n\nThe Truth!\nThere are countless companies that “claim” to give you something \"pure\" or \"natural,\" but it is just a lie and unless you know what to look for and what questions to ask, you will easily buy into it. More on that later... It is for this reason that I am so passionate about sharing the truth, facts and power behind essential oils. \n\nThis is also why I will only use essential oils from the trusted World Leader... The company who actually set the standard for and coined the term \"therapeutic grade essential oils,\" that countless companies have copied, and who exceeds all known medical standards such as AFNOR and ISO.  But I'm far from being the only one who feels this way.  See for yourself why so many professionals choose Young Living, exclusively. \n\nWhen your health is at stake and restoration and/or preservation is the goal, no short cuts should be taken and that goes with the quality of essential oils you use. You're health should be the #1 concern for the company, not how fat they can make their pocket book!\n\nAs you begin to understand the power that essential oils hold, such as their frequency compared to fresh or dried herbs and their chemistry, you’ll also understand the importance of obtaining authentic therapeutic grade essential oils.\n\nThis means that the entire process of obtaining therapeutic grade essential oils must be carefully watched over from the very beginning starting with what seed is picked to the time the oil is sealed in the bottle. This is known as the \"seed to seal\" process.\n\nIf you're purchasing from a reputable company, you should be able to and actually want to trace the entire seed to seal process that your oils go through to ensure their purity and potency, and no matter how costly these therapeutic grade essential oils may be, there should be NO substitute.\n\nThink about it... you wouldn’t buy a Rolls Royce and then put salt and water in the gas tank, would you? I learned the hard way and suffered the consequences for just putting cheap gas in my car for a short time. Trying to save a few dollars can sometimes cost us much more in the end. And I'm sure you'd agree that your body is far more valuable and delicate than any fancy car, right? Think about it... cars can be replaced, but you've only been given one body.\n\nAnd if this company your want to buy from is true on what it claims, it should be very easy to verify. In fact, you should even be given the opportunity to see first hand for yourself, and even encouraged to be apart of and participate in the harvesting and distilling process of the oils.\n\nLavender, for example, is harvested in the summer, so ask if the company you're buying from, or plan to buy from, if you can see the fields yourself and even be apart of and/or observe this amazing process. You should receive a nice warm welcome!\n\nTo be able to see and experience the fields and process yourself is simply amazing and for many, it can be life changing. I believe it is at this moment when one truly starts to grasp and appreciate what it takes to produce these precious plant oils.\n\nGrades of Essential Oils\nIt is important for everyone to understand that essential oils can best be categorized into four types or grades of oils:\n\nSynthetic or nature-identical oils. This basically means they were created in a lab. \nExtended or altered oils. These are also known as fragrance grade oils. These oils are filled with synthetic and petrochemical fillers.\nNatural oils (organic) and certified oils. These oils may pass oil-standard tests, but they may not actually contain any or only a few therapeutic compounds. These oils also usually have some synthetic and petrochemical fillers.\nTherapeutic grade essential oils. These are the oils that are pure, medicinal and steam distilled. These are the oils that contain ALL desired therapeutic compounds. This means, that no time or expense was spared to ensure that you are receiving the very best!\nWhen you find a bottle of lavender essential oil, for example, in a health food or novelty store for around $12 or so, that should raise a red flag. Why? Because synthetic or nature-identical oils can be created cheaply and then sold at a very low price while producing zero therapeutic power. Plus, they can actually be harmful.\n\nIn fact, fragrance-grade lavender essential oil can actually have a harmful effect instead of a healing effect on newly burned skin. However, if you grab a bottle of true therapeutic grade lavender essential oil your tears will turn into smiles within minutes. Believe me, I know from experience. Not only did my pain subside rather quickly, but the redness also went away and within the hour I actually forgot which hand I burned.\n\nHere's another trick to identifying adulterated oils that I like to show people... next time you go to the health food store pick up a bottle of lemon essential oil or similar that says \"100% pure\" and then read the fine print. What you'll find is a warning that says \"not for internal use.\" \n\nNow why in the world would we not be able to take a \"100% pure\" lemon essential oil internally. I'll tell you why. Because it's not 100% pure... not even close! Because this oil has an essential oil base, by law, it can be legally labeled \"100% Pure,\" \"Organic,\" or \"Natural.\"\n\nHowever, due to chemical impurities found in these extended or altered oils, even though they have an essential oil base, may be completely ineffective and/or cause negative effects, so please be careful!\n\nThey Can Say What?\n\nThe United States does not regulate the use of essential oils or the word aromatherapy on product packaging, labeling or in product advertising therefore labeling fraud is rampant.\n\nYes, that means they can pretty much say whatever they want to get you to buy their product, regardless of its true quality, and they do.\n\nBecause of the lack of quality standards within this industry many of these oils and oil enhanced products only contain a minute quantity of essential oil (5% is all that is required of the alleged oil), typically a low grade oil at that, which allows the company to profess that the oil or oil enhanced product is \"100% Pure,\" \"Natural,\" \"Organic,\" and yes, some are actually even claiming \"certified therapeutic grade essential oils\", so please use caution and do your homework before you buy!\n\nRegulations Update (June 2013)\n\nBecause of the onslaught of many synthetic essential oils on the market the FDA is finally going to requiring that some standards be put in place.  And they have asked none other than Gary Young, the worlds leader and most knowledgeable about essential oils.  \n\nThere will be a 3-tiered certification process that includes growing/harvesting practices, consistent, reliable and unbiased laboratory testing, and quality of essential oils.\n\nThis is excellent news for essential oil users wanting a therapeutic quality.  And those who don't meet these tough quality standards, but have been professing to provide this quality, will be found out.\n\nBuyer Beware...\n\nRegardless what the label states...\n\"98% of the essential oils sold are adulterated,\" have little to no \ntherapeutic compounds and are not fit for use!\n\nQuick Tips... What To Look For\nTo provide you with a helpful summary of what do look for when selecting authentic therapeutic grade essential oils, please follow the following tips:\n\nThe essential oil bottle should be in a dark amber or blue colored bottle, unless special circumstances apply. Be sure to get the facts though as this is a rare exception of which I only know of one.\nA bottle of lemon, peppermint, oregano, or helichrysum marked \"100% pure,\" \"natural,\" or \"therapeutic grade,\" for example, should NOT have a warning of \"not for internal use.\" There are actually only a few oils that are not recommended for internal use and that is because of the extraction method used.\nThe label for single essential oils should also provide the supplement facts and scientific name of the oil. Essential oil blends will only show the scientific names, unless it is a GRAS oil, such as Thieves. You may have to peel back the label to see this info, but you should clearly be able to see that the option is provided. And before you buy, ask to see it!\nIt should not have an expiration date on it.\nBefore using and especially ingesting any essential oil you will want your bottle to say...\n\"100% Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil Supplement\" and pass the quality assurance questions below.\nQuality Assurance\nAll of the information I provide on this site, which really is only the tip of the ice burg, is crucial when it comes to understanding essential oil quality. If you follow the quick tips above you should be safe. However, if you want to take things one step further, below are some questions you can also ask your essential oil supplier and/or rep to ensure you are receiving a therapeutic grade essential oil… one that has the purity and potency to bring about natural healing.\n\nKnowledge Is Power!\n\nThe more you know the better chance you will void being lied too and possibly being injured.\n\nAre the fragrances delicate, rich, and organic? Do they “feel” natural? Do the aromas vary from batch to batch as an indication that they are painstakingly distilled in small batches rather than industrially processed on a larger scale?\nDoes your supplier subject each batch of essential oils through multiple chemical analyses to test for purity and therapeutic quality? \nAre these tests performed by independent labs?\nDoes your supplier have their own farms and personally grow and distill organically grown herbs?\nAre the distillation facilities part of the farm where the herbs are grown (to ensure the herbs are freshly distilled), or do herbs wait days to be processed and lose potency?\nDoes your supplier use low pressure and low temperature to distill essential oils so as to preserve all of their fragile chemical constituents? \nAre the distillation cookers fabricated from costly, food-grade stainless steel alloys to reduce the likelihood of the oils chemically reacting with metal?\nDoes your supplier personally inspect the fields and distilleries where the herbs are grown and distilled? \nDo they verify that no synthetic or harmful solvents or chemicals are being used?\nHow many years has your supplier been doing all of this?\nAnd here is a big one... \"Does the company utilize gas chromatography (GC) in their quality control process?\" AND \"Does their GC equipment utilize a column of at least 50 to 60 meters in length in order to properly identify the hundreds of natural constituents found in an essential oil?\" Almost all labs in the United States use a 30-meter column that is not long enough to achieve proper separation of all the essential oil constituents. A gas chromatogram shows a pattern of the separated constituents of an oil and helps a trained technician determine its purity and therapeutic quality. \nEven if you’ve been given a positive yes to these questions still ask them if they can provide some proof such as documentation or better yet, ask if you come see the farm/distilleries/equipment for yourself. \n\nAgain, if the company has nothing to hide then these will be available options and actually encouraged by the company and/or its representatives. \n\nEssential Oil Application\nIf you are using a true authentic therapeutic grade essential oil you should be able to safely apply, ingest and inhale your oils, except where restrictions apply. You should also be able to safely use them during pregnancy, on your children and even your pets!\n\nAgain, a peppermint essential oil bottle that says “100% Pure” should NOT have in fine print on the back “not for internal use.” If it does, please don’t waste your money and put yourself at risk.\n\nHowever, even if the bottle does say \"therapeutic grade essential oil\" or even \"certified therapeutic grade essential oil\" which really means nothing unless it is a Young Living Essential Oil because again, companies can claim anything they want, check the bottle and ask the questions. \n\nTo learn about essential oil applications, please visit my how to use essential oils page to learn more.  You can also learn more about the many uses for essential oils.\n\nWhy Young Living Essential Oils?\nIn short, because they are the real deal and can back-up everything they claim. They are not the tail, but the head in the industry and it is others who are trying to follow and/or copy them, even to the names of their oils. Pretty sad, I think!\n\nYoung Living is not ran by some guy who has zero to little experience working with essential oils and is in this for the business or money side only, but by a man who has dedicated his life to discovering and producing for us the very best in essential oils, for our health and the health of our children. Oils that are known throughout the world for their purity and potency and because they work!. Ask anyone using Young Living Essential Oils and that's what you'll hear time and time again.\n\nI encourage you to learn more about Young Living Essential Oils (YLEO), the World Leader in essential oils.\n\nOur Oils are Just as Good as YLEO, Only a Lot Cheaper\nThere are only three things a business can sell:\n\nQuality\nService\nPrice \nWhen a company focuses on the lowest prices, can it really maintain the same level of product quality and offer the same abundance of services provided by a company whose focus is on quality and service? It is not financially possible to do so.\n\nIn evaluating such companies, ask them: \"Do they engage in the same level of pioneering research and quality assurance that Gary Young and YLEO does and has always done.\" Gary Young and YLEO have invested millions in research to find new oils, better ways to distill and extract oils, better ways to grow and harvest plants that make oils, as well as more effective ways to apply oils to more human diseases and conditions. Gary has been tireless and unceasing in his search for knowledge and understanding to find and use God's natural products to the fullest potential to which God has imbued them. In my opinion, Gary Young has no equal in this regard.\n\nIf YLEO oils are more expensive than some other brands, part of the reason is that YLEO puts millions back into research and development. They constantly spend money for testing in their own lab, as well as in independent labs outside to guarantee and maintain purity and therapeutic grade quality. What other company invests so much and goes to such pains to \"produce the highest-quality essential oils?\" \n\nWe Get Our Oils from the Same Supplier as YLEO\n\nA statement competing companies often make is \"We purchase our oils from the same sources as Young Living.\" You need to understand that wholesale and bulk-oil sellers sell many grades of oil. The same company may sell several levels of quality, from the cheapest perfume grades to high-quality therapeutic grades.\n\nDo these new companies know the difference? Do they go to the expense to test and make sure of what they are getting with every batch they receive? Perhaps they have cheaper prices because they are selling lesser grades of oils, which they may have purchased from some of the same suppliers as Young Living, but they are not the same quality as those demanded and verified by Gary and YLEO.\n\nWithout investing in the testing technology necessary to guarantee quality, how can such companies even know what they are purchasing and selling? Such testing costs money, which is one reason YLEO oils may cost more. Quality assurance is expensive. You cannot offer the lowest prices and the highest quality at the same time.\n\n*Note: Information above was adopted from the article \"Our Oils are Just as Good as YLEO, Only a Lot Cheaper\" by David Stewart, Ph.D., RA, DNM\n\nSetting The Standard Since 1993\nSince 1993 Young Living Essential Oils has been setting the standard for therapeutic grade essential oils and are the world leader for a reason. And it is because of their unsurpassed commitment to quality that they are the only essential oils I will use or recommend.","img_small":null,"img_med":null,"img_large":null,"source":"FACEB","hashtag":"testing"},{"id":"668645206_10153107039185207","user":"668645206","time":"2013-08-14T17:48:25.000Z","lat":null,"lon":null,"text":"I didn't sleep well last night.
